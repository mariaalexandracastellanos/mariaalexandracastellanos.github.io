title: "Immigration, Parenthood and Child Penalties"
collection: research
permalink: /research/paper1
excerpt: 'In this paper I analyse the impact of a larger provision of domestic services
on child penalties, focusing on the Spanish migration boom as an exceptional case
study. The sudden supply shock in domestic and childcare services stemming from
this event provides a unique quasi-experimental setting to examine whether the
availability of affordable childcare and household services can reduce gender disparities
and the penalties associated with parenthood. Using a novel individual-level
measure of child penalty and a rich employer-employee administrative dataset, I
find that the expansion of affordable domestic services driven by the inflow of female
immigrant workers reduced the child penalties gender gap for native workers.
The effect is persistent over time and more pronounced for relatively lower-skilled
native women, suggesting that affordable substitutes for household production can
help not only to alleviate gender gaps but also to reduce within-gender disparities.'
