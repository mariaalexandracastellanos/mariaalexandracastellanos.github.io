### Immigration, Parenthood and Child Penalties

<small> *María Alexandra Castellanos*</small>

This paper analyses the impact of an immigration-induced expansion of household services on parenthood costs. The sudden supply shock in domestic and childcare services stemming from the Spanish migration boom provides a unique quasi-experimental setting to examine whether the availability of affordable substitutes for household production can reduce both gender disparities in the labour market and the penalties associated with parenthood. Using a novel individual-level measure of child penalty and a rich matched employer-employee administrative dataset, I combine a difference-in-differences strategy with an instrumental-variable design. I find that the expansion of domestic services driven by a large inflow of female immigrant workers reduced the gender gap associated with child penalties for native workers. The effect is persistent over time and more pronounced for low-skilled native women, suggesting that affordable substitutes for household production can help not only to alleviate gender gaps but also to reduce within-gender inequality.

### Quasi-Random Matches: Evidence from Dual Labor Markets"

<small>*María Alexandra Castellanos, Henry Redondo, Jan Stuhler*</small>

A fast-growing literature studies how sorting into particular jobs, firms, or locations
affects workers. The key challenge when studying such questions is the
non-random sorting of workers into jobs. We propose a novel identification strategy
that exploits the timing of worker-firm matching. We isolate quasi-random variation
in matches by interacting high-frequency information on the duration of contracts
on the labor supply and transitory fluctuations in job creation on the labor demand
side. We apply this method to address a central question in dual labor markets: how
do different contract types – fixed-term or open-ended contracts – affect workers’
careers? We find that transitory variation in the opening of permanent contracts
is highly predictive of individual promotion probabilities and has long-lasting effects
on earnings, employment, and the accumulation of experience in permanent
positions.

### Immigration and native labour market outcomes. New Evidence from Spain

<small>*María Alexandra Castellanos*</small>

Understanding the effect of immigration in native labour market outcomes represents one of
the most debated questions in the economic literature, after decades of research, no consensus
has been reached. This paper addresses this question in the context of the immigration
wave to Spain of the 2000’s through a pure spatial correlation approach. To identify causal
estimates, the study applies an instrumental variable strategy exploiting information on early
immigrant settlements from the two previous decades. I implements an event-study
design that allows to closely evaluate prior labour market trajectories. The results
suggest that immigration led to large negative local employment responses for low-skilled
workers, but only mild wage effects. Analysing margins of adjustment, I show that the strong displacement effects are not necessarily attributable to job-losses, but mainly driven by a reduction of native inflows into work in more exposed regions.
