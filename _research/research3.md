Understanding the effect of immigration in native labour market outcomes represents one of
the most debated questions in the economic literature, after decades of research, no consensus
has been reached. This paper addresses this question in the context of the immigration
wave to Spain of the 2000’s through a pure spatial correlation approach. To identify causal
estimates, the study applies an instrumental variable strategy exploiting information on early
immigrant settlements from the two previous decades. Additionally, it implements an eventstudy
design that allows to closely evaluate prior labour market trajectories. The results
suggest that immigration led to large negative local employment responses for low-skilled
workers, but only mild wage effects. Analysing margins of adjustment, it is found that the
strong displacement effects are not necessarily attributable to job-losses, but mainly driven
by a reduction of native inflows into work in more exposed regions. <br>
