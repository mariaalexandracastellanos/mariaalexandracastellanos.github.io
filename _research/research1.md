title: "Immigration, Parenthood and Child Penalties"
collection: research
excerpt: 'In this paper I analyse the impact of a larger provision of domestic services
on child penalties, focusing on the Spanish migration boom as an exceptional case
study. The sudden supply shock in domestic and childcare services stemming from
this event provides a unique quasi-experimental setting to examine whether the
availability of affordable childcare and household services can reduce gender disparities
and the penalties associated with parenthood. Using a novel individual-level
measure of child penalty and a rich employer-employee administrative dataset, I
find that the expansion of affordable domestic services driven by the inflow of female
immigrant workers reduced the child penalties gender gap for native workers.
The effect is persistent over time and more pronounced for relatively lower-skilled
native women, suggesting that affordable substitutes for household production can
help not only to alleviate gender gaps but also to reduce within-gender disparities.'

title: "Quasi-Random Matches: Evidence from Dual Labor Markets"
collection: research
excerpt: '(joint with Henry Redondo and Jan Stuhler)
A fast-growing literature studies how sorting into particular jobs, firms, or locations
affects workers. The key challenge when studying such questions is the
non-random sorting of workers into jobs. We propose a novel identification strategy
that exploits the timing of worker-firm matching. We isolate quasi-random variation
in matches by interacting high-frequency information on the duration of contracts
on the labor supply and transitory fluctuations in job creation on the labor demand
side. We apply this method to address a central question in dual labor markets: how
do different contract types – fixed-term or open-ended contracts – affect workers’
careers? We find that transitory variation in the opening of permanent contracts
is highly predictive of individual promotion probabilities and has long-lasting effects
on earnings, employment, and the accumulation of experience in permanent
positions.'
