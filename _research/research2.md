A fast-growing literature studies how sorting into particular jobs, firms, or lo-
cations affects workers. The key challenge when studying such questions is the
non-random sorting of workers. We propose a novel identification strategy that
exploits the timing of worker-firm matching, by interacting high-frequency informa-
tion on the duration of contracts on the labour supply and transitory fluctuations in
job creation on the labour demand side. We apply this method to address a central
question in dual labour markets: how do different contract types – fixed-term or
permanent contracts – affect workers’ careers? We find that transitory variation
in the opening of permanent contracts is highly predictive of individual contract
upgrade probabilities. Reaching a permanent position translates into higher em-
ployment and earnings growth in the short-run. However, the stability derived from
these positions does not seem to lead to long-lasting earnings growth differentials. <br>
