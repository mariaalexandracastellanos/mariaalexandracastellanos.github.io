A fast-growing literature studies how sorting into particular jobs, firms, or locations
affects workers. The key challenge when studying such questions is the
non-random sorting of workers into jobs. We propose a novel identification strategy
that exploits the timing of worker-firm matching. We isolate quasi-random variation
in matches by interacting high-frequency information on the duration of contracts
on the labor supply and transitory fluctuations in job creation on the labor demand
side. We apply this method to address a central question in dual labor markets: how
do different contract types – fixed-term or open-ended contracts – affect workers’
careers? We find that transitory variation in the opening of permanent contracts
is highly predictive of individual promotion probabilities and has long-lasting effects
on earnings, employment, and the accumulation of experience in permanent
positions. <br>
